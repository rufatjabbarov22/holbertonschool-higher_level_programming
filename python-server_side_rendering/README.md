Server-side rendering is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully formed HTML. This contrasts with client-side rendering, where the browser builds the web page using JavaScript and dynamic data. Through this project, you will learn how to implement SSR using Python and Flask, leveraging the Jinja templating engine to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly web applications.

Learning Objectives
Understand the concepts of server-side rendering and how it differs from client-side rendering.
Learn the benefits of using server-side rendering in web development.
Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework.
Utilize Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages.
Read and display data from various sources including JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases.
Handle dynamic content and user inputs in web applications.
What to Expect
In this project, you will build a Flask application that serves web pages using server-side rendering techniques. You will start by creating basic templates and gradually move towards integrating dynamic content from multiple data sources. By the end of the project, you will have a comprehensive understanding of SSR, templating, and how to build efficient, scalable web applications.
